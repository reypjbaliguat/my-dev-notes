title: MongoDB TTL Index
description: Why expiresAt alone does not delete documents
---

## Problem

Adding `expiresAt` does **not** automatically delete documents.

## Solution

Create a TTL index:

```js
db.sessions.createIndex({ expiresAt: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 0 });
```

<Warning>
  TTL cleanup runs every ~60 seconds. Always validate expiration in your
  application code.
</Warning>
